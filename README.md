A place for my Node Module and Package Management scripts and notes

## Packages
Package.json files describe file trees as described by the Node docs. It's useful to think about each package.json file as its own seperate tree, suggesting the leaf node of a package is the last directory BEFORE entering a new directory with a pacakge.json or node_modules.
